Hello everyone, this is my first blog post.  I wanted to share why I decided to learn software engineering here at Flatiron. I chose  software engineering because I have always been interested in technology of all kinds.  I have always been the guy who repairs and fixes things for fun.  As as a hobby I enjoy diagnosing and repairing cars, trucks and motorcycles. I also like to work with computers for fun.  I like the idea of being creative at my job and I like being able to make and fix things that are useful and helpful to the end user.  It is exciting to know that there are many different opportunities available in this field.  I look forward to the challenges of learning software engineering and becoming a software engineer.
