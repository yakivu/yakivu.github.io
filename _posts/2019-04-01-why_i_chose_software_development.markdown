I decided to learn software development because I have always been interested in technology of all kinds.  I have always been the guy who repairs and fixes things for fun.  As as a hobby I enjoy diagnosing and repairing cars, trucks and motorcycles. I also like to work with computers for fun. I like the idea of being creative at my job and I like being able to make and fix things that are useful and helpful to the end user.  I look forward to the challenges of learning software development and becoming a software developer.
